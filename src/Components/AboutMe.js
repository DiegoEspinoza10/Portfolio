          <h3>Experience</h3>
          <h4>Â· Web developer</h4>
          <p>
            Designed and implemented a web application that was compatible with multiple browsers and devices.
            The tools our team used to create the web application were Laravel for the back-end, SQL for the database, and ReactJs for the front-end.
            My involvement mainly focused on creating the Rest API with all the necessary methods and requirements, setting up the database,
            and testing the API with Postman.
